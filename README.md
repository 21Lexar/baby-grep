# baby-grep
 A baby version of the most famous GNU program.

## Motivation 
I always thought how grep is able to take commands while executing the program.
While I was researching on it, I found out that the thing I used to feel that used to blank my mind at an instant is actually a revolutionary thing.
>int argc, char* argv[]

was probably the most interesting thing I have ever learnt in programming. 
So I thought why not write a baby version of my favourite GNU program "grep"

## Installation
I wouldn't suggest installing because the GOAT grep already is installed in your pc but if you wanna really test my program,
then just follow the steps
1. Open Terminal
2. Clone this repo
> https://github.com/21Lexar/baby-grep.git
3. run the following command
> ./bin/program "word-you-want-to-search" file_name.txt

And there you have it this is it.
